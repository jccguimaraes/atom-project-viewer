## Working on Feature

- [ ] Drag & Drop groups and items;
  - [ ] Drag and drop a group or item into a group will add it as a child;
  - [ ] Drag and drop a group or item into an item will add it as sibling of the dropped item;
  - [ ] Drag and drop a group or item into a clear space in the panel will add it as a root child;
  - [ ] Order dragged group / item accordingly with dropped group sorting.
